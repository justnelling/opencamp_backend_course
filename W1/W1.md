mid-term assignment presentation in week 4

submission of assignment in week 9

technical skills:

- event driven systems
- monitoring and observability

soft skills:

- technical research + writing
- technical review + critique
- peer disc
- business / product thinking

1-on-1s with Victor every 2 weeks

can talk about anything:

- job search
- work-related challenges
- anything really

## Topic 1: Motivations for Distributed Systems

### Flow of data

- data storage: replication & consistency
- events and strreaming data
- API and architecture design

### Designing for failures (risk managment)

- data storage: partitions
- 8 fallacies of distributed computing
- risk management
  - what happens if â€˜Service Zâ€™ goes down, or if DB 1 goes down? What is the risk to the provision of services

can think of distributed systems as complexity management

and there are trade-offs on how to maintain the scale of distributed systems

## 1.1 The Flow of Data

### **Scenario: inventory warehouse**

â†’ what kind of data will be flowing into the system?

- product ID, price, supplier ID, buyer ID, sender address, buyer address, quantity, product metadata (SKUs), require cold warehousing, time inventory entered the warehouse, time the inventory needs to be moved out, category of product

â†’ what kind of data will need to be shown (to different users)?

- Define which users will use what kind of data?
- Floor managers, movers, stocktakers
- if there are robots to move the equipment, they will need structured data
- if humans, different types of data
- for stocktakers or data analysts, they will need metadata to calculate inventory space metrics, or do predictions for stakeholders / business owners

**designing distributed systems requires us to take into account the flow of data:**

- what data is entering / leaving the system
- who owns the data?
- who needs to view the data?
- what kind of format should the data be stored / viewed / transformed into?
- how consistent do we need the data?

data warehouse is used by data analysts to do data analysis on the state of the pipeline, or the inventory of the warehouse, etc.

### 1.2 8 Fallacies of Distributed Computing & Risk Management

designing distributed systems requires us to identify and predict potential failure points and scenarios, and make a **conscious decision** to address them or not.

Risk is managed, not ignored or excessively obsessed over.

its about identifying the most critical components in your pipeline, and accepting that you canâ€™t risk manage EVERYTHING, you HAVE to CHOOSE. What is the most critical services to the business use case.

### Risk conversations

- what is ok to fail for a short period of time?
- can we recover or recompute the data? (data warehouses work on the assumption that they wonâ€™t have the latest version of the data, and so they account for having to recompute the data)
- how fast can we recover if something goes wrong?
- how easy is it monitor and detect errors?
- how often / easy can we perform maintenance?

## Assignment

extend a distributed social media platform (an existing one: bluesky)

1. product: let user post and upload their location check-ins, similar to Foursquare / Swarm with **GPS coordinates and Photos**, with a global newsfeed
2. built on top of either AT protocol (bluesky) or ActivityPub (mastodon)
3. Test with actual production traffic up to the limits of your own hardware, using either your own hardware, using either your own machine or via the cloud ( at your own cost)

**w1**: need to write a 3 page **technical paper** on research of how i plan to build this

part of it shd include an analysis between these 2 protocols, weighing pros and cons.

people are building new products with them:

- Pixelfed (instagram-clone) with ActivityPub
- SmokeSignal (meetup clone) with AT protocol

### Structure for the technical paper

1. introduce the problem statement â€” to build a foursquare / swarm clone, in the context of testing actual production traffic
2. AT protocol overview (1/2 page)
3. ActivityPub overview (1/2 page)
4. Comparative Analysis
   1. pros + cons of AT protocol
   2. pros + cons of activity pub
   3. do a small comparison table
5. Protocol selection and justification
6. Implementation plan and conclusion
   1. Data modeling: how i plan to represent â€˜check-insâ€™, locations, users and social interactions within the chosen protocolâ€™s data model
   2. user interface and user experience
   3. key features (plans on how to implement core foursquare / swarm features: check-ins, location search, photo uplaods, global feed)
   4. challenges and considerations (potential challenges i anticipate, etc.)

Key areas to focus

notes:

- look up what is gRPC
